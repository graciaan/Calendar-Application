# Welcome to the Work Day Scheduler application!
This site is meant to be used as a day scheduler. There is a form for each hour of the work day, from 8:00am to 5:00pm.
The site shows through color-coding whether the hour is in the past, present, or future.
The site uses local-storage to save and store the information typed in to each hour. This information will stay on the site as long as you save it.

The site can be accessed directly through https://graciaan.github.io/Calendar-Application/
